<h1>About the game</h1>
<p>This is very easy game. This game is very convenient for testing your knowledge about the most famous countries' capital cities.
This is beginning but every start is a preparation for the process. </p>

<h1>Preparing the game</h1>
<p>I used all my knowledge from the school while preparing this game. Especially using of DOM helped me a lot. Since our teacher declared about this project, 
I already started creating the game in my mind. I've got some help from Youtubers. You can see below how I planned in the beginning. </p>

<p>As you can see this is very simple plan. I added some more. I made a description on the starter page that explains how the game works. 
On the other hand, when you quit or finish the game, you will see the description of your results. </p>
